# 🎯 Final Setup & Testing Guide

## ✅ All Polyfills Added

The following Node.js polyfills have been configured:
- ✅ `buffer`
- ✅ `events`  
- ✅ `util`
- ✅ `process`

## 🔧 Complete Setup Steps

### Step 1: Install All Dependencies

```bash
# Parent dependencies
cd parent
npm install process events util buffer

# Caretaker dependencies  
cd ../Caretaker
npm install process events util buffer

# Go back to root
cd ..
```

### Step 2: Kill All Node Processes

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
taskkill /F /IM node.exe
```

### Step 3: Clear Browser Cache

**In BOTH Chrome windows:**
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Select "Cached images and files"
3. Click "Clear data"
4. Close all browser windows

### Step 4: Start Fresh (Correct Order)

**Terminal 1 - Server:**
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```
**✅ Wait for:** `✅ Connected to MongoDB`

---

**Terminal 2 - Parent (Start FIRST):**
```bash
cd parent
npm run dev
```

1. Open **NEW** Chrome window: http://localhost:5174
2. Press `F12` to open Console
3. Enter room ID: `100`
4. Click: **"Join Call"**
5. You should see: `👶 Parent: Joining room 100`

**⚠️ LEAVE THIS WINDOW OPEN - Don't close or refresh!**

---

**Terminal 3 - Caretaker (Start SECOND):**
```bash
cd Caretaker
npm run dev
```

1. Open **DIFFERENT** Chrome window: http://localhost:5173
2. Press `F12` to open Console  
3. Allow camera when prompted
4. Enter room ID: `100` (same as parent)
5. Click: **"Start Call"**

---

## 📋 Expected Console Logs

### Caretaker Console (http://localhost:5173):
```
🎯 Caretaker: Starting call for room: 100 isCaller: true
📹 Caretaker: Requesting camera...
✅ Caretaker: Camera access granted
🔗 Caretaker: Joining room 100
🤝 Caretaker: Creating SimplePeer, initiator: true
📡 Caretaker: Sending signal type: offer
```

### Parent Console (http://localhost:5174):
```
👶 Parent: Joining room 100
🆕 Parent: New peer joined: [socket-id]
📡 Parent: Received signal type: offer from: [socket-id]
🤝 Parent: Creating SimplePeer as receiver
📤 Parent: Sending answer signal type: answer
✅ Parent: Peer connected
🎥 Parent: Receiving caretaker stream
```

### Server Terminal:
```
👥 [parent-id] joined room 100
👥 [caretaker-id] joined room 100
📡 Signal from [caretaker-id] to room, type: offer
📢 Broadcasting to room: 100
📡 Signal from [parent-id] to [caretaker-id], type: answer
```

---

## ✅ Success Indicators

**Parent Interface:**
- ✅ Green text: "Connected - Watching live stream"
- ✅ Video shows caretaker's camera feed
- ✅ Video is playing smoothly

**Caretaker Interface:**
- ✅ Shows own camera feed
- ✅ Console shows connection success

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Error: "process is not defined"
**Solution:**
```bash
cd parent
npm install process
# Then restart: Ctrl+C and npm run dev
```

### Error: "Cannot read properties of undefined"
**Solution:**
```bash
cd parent
npm install events util buffer
# Then restart
```

### Issue: Parent shows "Waiting for caretaker..."
**Possible causes:**
1. **Caretaker hasn't started yet** → Start caretaker
2. **Different room IDs** → Verify both use "100"
3. **Parent joined after caretaker** → Refresh parent, join first

**Fix:** Always start parent BEFORE caretaker!

### Issue: Multiple "candidate" signals in server logs
**This is NORMAL during development** due to:
- React Strict Mode (runs effects twice)
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR) reloads

**In production build**, this won't happen.

### Issue: Client joining room twice
**Cause:** React Strict Mode in development
**Impact:** None - this is normal behavior
**Fix:** Not needed, works correctly despite logs

## 🎬 Quick Test Command

Run this if you want to test everything at once:

```bash
# Stop all processes
taskkill /F /IM node.exe 2>nul

# Start server in background
start cmd /k "cd server && npm run dev"

# Wait 3 seconds
timeout /t 3 /nobreak

# Start parent
start cmd /k "cd parent && npm run dev"

# Wait 3 seconds  
timeout /t 3 /nobreak

# Start caretaker
start cmd /k "cd Caretaker && npm run dev"
```

Then:
1. Open http://localhost:5174 → Join room `100`
2. Open http://localhost:5173 → Start call room `100`
